I do have some options available that can protect you from racking up a large bill called Hospital Indemnity plans. Basically, in exchange for a low premium you can get a cash benefit paid directly to you for each day you spend in the hospital and can use that money for anything you need without restrictions. I'm going to compare some options with you because you might really benefit from this, not to mention the peace of mind it would bring you. Please grab your pen and paper one more time."</p>
